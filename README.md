## Guess or Dare Game

### About
Guess or Dare is an online multiplayer game that is designed to accommodate a team-building scenario between people who are not physically together. Identifying communication barriers as one of the major root cause for boredom during quarantine, this game aims to combine interactive experience and real-time components to mimic physical interactions. 

Players can join a room where they will be divided into two separate teams, one being the guesser and the other being the answerer. A word will be assigned to the latter team, and the guesser team will have 5 chances to ask questions and look for hints. The QnA will be real-time and dynamic, making the game interactive. The team will win if they correctly guess the word before the question count runs out. After the game ends, the winning team can spin a wheel of dares to give a fun escapade for the losing team.

Accompanied with working chatbots to allow discussion and strategy-planning amongst team members, automatic team formation, and live QnA between teams to guess the word, Guess or Dare can easily become your go-to game whenever youâ€™re looking for some quarantine-fun!
